# Argonne

This is a repo containing the work done at Argonne National Lab during the summer of '18 with the ATLAS group and the 2020-2021 year with the CPAC group.

Inside ATLAS:
-------------
"collisionSimulator.cpp" is the code for my first project. In this file, I take in the mass of a beam and output the kinetic energy of the discharged proton as the beam collides with deuterium to create a heavy isotope. The kinetic energy of the proton per the angle is sent to "output.txt".

"plotter.cpp" is the file use in ROOT CERN to plot the data from "output.txt".
