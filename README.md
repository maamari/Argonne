# Argonne

This is a repo containing the work done during the summer of '18 at Argonne National Laboratory.

"collisionSimulator.cpp" is the code for my first project. In this file, I take in the mass of a beam and output the kinetic energy of the discharged proton as the beam collides with deuterium to create a heavy isotope. The kinetic energy of the proton per the angle is sent to "output.txt".

"plotter.cpp" is the file use in ROOT CERN to plot the data from "output.txt".

Please feel free to reach out regarding any questions.
